# Predictor

This is a Python simulation of the PREDICTOR strategy for the iterated prisoners dilemma, as presented in [1]. The python implementation is called predictor and calculates tournament placement as function of exploration time. In order to run PREDICTOR.py, you first need to create a virtual environment according to the requirements file.
Also included is the mathematica notbook Results.nb used to visualize the results and create figures for the paper.
